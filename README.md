Due to an increase in workload, Lesedi needs a faster way to draw up contracts and get them signed by the respective parties. She has decided to hire a skilled developer to **build a dynamic web application** that allows her to populate the following dynamic values:

- Name of client
- Contract start and end date
- Service cost
- Service description
